<h2 class="title">How to Succeed</h2> 
<h4>September 26,2022 by Leanna Dehaney</h4>

Some people would say that all you need to do is work hard to achieve what you want in life. 
Some people think it's about who you know or what you have. 
Yet others feel there are those born with access and that they are given all the breaks in life.
The truth is, statistics demonstrate that those who create goals and have a regular and consistent 
goal-setting process are much more likely to achieve their life’s dreams. 
Regardless of how hard you work, if you are aiming for the wrong dream, 
then all that effort will only get you to the wrong destination faster, and that would be extremely disappointing.
Despite connections, you still have to continuously demonstrate to everyone that you were worthy of receiving the opportunity in the first place. 
Eventually, proving your worth to others becomes exhausting. However, there is a formula for turning your dreams 
into reality, and it isn't dependent on who you know or proving yourself.<br>
The formula is: goals + commitment = dreams come true <br>
By having clear goals,you become aware of precisely what you want to achieve and how to go about doing it. 
You are able to more accurately assess and measure your ability to accomplish the goals and most importantly, 
you have a plan that can guide you along the way and keep you on track. 
Add commitment and determination to your goals and you will find that you are willing to take continuous and 
consistent action toward making your dreams a reality, despite any obstacles in your path, including difficult times.
Having goals and staying committed to them will keep your focus on the things that you have identified as essential to 
reaching your desired outcomes. Too often, we expend precious time on issues that have nothing to do with what we really 
want in our lives. We get distracted by focusing on what others are doing and achieving, and striving to do the same.
Having a vision and a supporting plan of what you want to achieve in life is necessary if you ever want to arrive at 
the correct destination.</article><hr>
<h2 class="title">Health Matters Too-Exercise</h2>

Exercise can help prevent excess weight gain or help maintain weight loss. When you engage in physical activity, 
you burn calories. The more intense the activity, the more calories you burn. Regular trips to the gym are great, but 
don't worry if you can't find a large chunk of time to exercise every day. Any amount of activity is better than none 
at all. To reap the benefits of exercise, just get more active throughout your day — take the stairs instead of the 
elevator or rev up your household chores. Consistency is key.Worried about heart disease? Hoping to prevent high blood pressure? 
No matter what your current weight is, being active boosts high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the "good" cholesterol, 
and it decreases unhealthy triglycerides. This one-two punch keeps your blood flowing smoothly, which decreases your risk of 
cardiovascular diseases.<br> Need an emotional lift? Or need to destress after a stressful day? A gym session or brisk walk 
can help. Physical activity stimulates various brain chemicals that may leave you feeling happier, more relaxed and less anxious. 
You may also feel better about your appearance and yourself when you exercise regularly, which can boost your confidence and 
improve your self-esteem.Winded by grocery shopping or household chores? Regular physical activity can improve your muscle 
strength and boost your endurance. Exercise delivers oxygen and nutrients to your tissues and helps your cardiovascular 
system work more efficiently. And when your heart and lung health improve, you have more energy to tackle daily chores.</article>
